## Skills
Through this project, I've gotten comfortable with introducing all kinds of lists, anchor tags, as well as images.

More importantly, now I understand how the browser structures content into new rows when they are added.

Perhaps the most important skill I've practiced here, that I wasn't so familiar before, is Git. I have done a few programming courses in the past, and they just explained Git briefly, but I was scared of it since it seemed very complicated to keep track of all the time.

But, after only this one project, I already feel more comfortable, and can't wait to see all of my other skills stack up after going through the whole Odin Project.
